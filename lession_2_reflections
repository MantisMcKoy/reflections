its how you start to save changes and make a commit and stuff yo

the staging area allows multiple things to be added in at once

you can use the diff operators to check that you change exactly what you want to and nothign more or less

I need to add the master tag and which branch im on id

it allows me to see the visibility of commits relative to branches and each other

this allows devs to work independently and creat different things at the same time and then t just combine the code together

pros are that merging is awesome the con is that computers cant figure everything out on their on, if 2 devs are working with sections of code that are related at all there is a chance of 
creating conflicts which must be manually sorted
